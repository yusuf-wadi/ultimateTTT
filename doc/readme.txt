Hello grader!

This is the developers side notes section.

If i were to redo this code, I believe i would have optimized it more to user experience. 
To elaborate on this point and in specificity, I would have displayed each 
tic tac toe grid onto a byte field of size x. 
This would have allowed me to manuever and print each byte onto a precise location, rather than rely on moving row by row. 
This change would also have allowed users to view the game more simply rather than how it is currently displayed.
